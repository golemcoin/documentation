In this tutorial, we will guide you through the Golem Network Token migration process. We hope with this tutorial, you should be fully ready and feel more confident to migrate your GNT to GLM, the new token. 

**How to migrate my old GNT to the new Golem tokens?**

For any remaining GNT tokens that have not yet been migrated, we have decided to conduct the migration directly using migration smart contract, rather than using a migration user interface that is no longer supported. This makes the migration process for the remaining old GNT token holders simple.

The migration smart contract, created solely for migration purposes, allows you to migrate your GNT tokens without connecting to any external platforms. The migration smart contract address is open-source, meaning the code can be checked by anyone.

Using the migration contract requires users to pay the gas fee on the Ethereum Blockchain. This means every user who wants to perform migration needs to have ETH in their wallet. The migration process is similar to any other transaction on the Ethereum Blockchain, and the gas fee is the same as any other transaction. We recommend choosing the average (normal) gas fee to avoid any inconvenience.

The migration can be conducted with any wallet you usually use to access the GNT tokens, such as MyEtherWallet, Ledger, MetaMask, Trezor, Klever, Exodus, Bitpie, Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet, etc. All wallets support the migration process, and the procedure is the same for all wallets.

**How long do I have to migrate?**

The migration process won’t end - smart contracts are unstoppable :)

**Will it be a 1:1 swap so the new token will have the same fixed supply?**

Yes, it will be 1:1. Migration is gradual and converging towards the same maximum total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens.

Yes, it will be 1:1. Migration is gradual and converging towards the same maximum total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens.

**My GLM is not visible on wallet, how can I add it?**
Add the token address manually: `0x7dd9c5cba05e151c895fde1cf355c9a1d5da6429`.

### Steps to Start Migration Process

**Access Your Wallet:** Check your GNT balance in the list of Ethereum tokens.

**Send Tokens:** Send your GNT tokens to the migration smart contract address `0x98e0Fc1130f920Bc751AAD401c77EAEC01B51eaB`. The migration smart contract address begins with `0x98` and ends with `1eaB`. The case of letters does not matter (lower case or upper case), and apostrophes are not part of the address.
Choose to send the **entire balance** of GNT tokens. The migration contract will wait for the **full balance** to arrive before initiating the migration process to optimize due to high Ethereum gas fees.

**Confirmation:** After the transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the blockchain, the migration process will start, and your wallet will be credited with new GLM tokens. Depending on network usage, it may take 1–5 minutes to process the migration.

### Post-Migration
Your wallet will **automatically** recognize the new Golem tokens, and GLM will be credited to your wallet once the migration is complete.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully performed the migration.
